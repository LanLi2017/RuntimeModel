# RuntimeModel
# Web API: 
  
  a. A(Raw Dataset) => 

  b. Two column levels: each level has one operation: simplest case. 
	  
  c. Conceptual level (Yesworkflow)-- runtime level  ( show it in command-line)

	Parallel model:
	  A
	/  \
       B    C
	\  /
	 D
	
	Save time
	Write the timer (structuralize the recipe…) verify the "saving"
	
  Compare:  (run both models  on the same command-line)
	
  Same size of the dataset, enlarge the columns levels? (more levels you have, the performance will be better );
	Keep the columns level same, 
	
  Runtime---- x-axis: column levels (), y-axis: runtime; 
	Or the size of the dataset.
